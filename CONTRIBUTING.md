# Contributing to overcast-maps

The repository (stratus-maps) is for Minecraft maps that are in the Stratus Network map repository.

Please only submit the most recent version of your map which is in the Stratus Network repository as this version is almost guaranteed not to have any outstanding issues. If you cannot retrieve this version one of our staff with access to the full repository will be able to supply the download.

For your map to be displayed on our website you must also create a pull request on our [website repository](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io).
